* Description
- This started as a way to adapt my earlier account maintenance programs to use ~snscrape~, since the free version of Twitter's API is inadequate for my purposes
** July 7, 2023
- Then, Twitter made their site unavailable to the public, and ~snscrape~ no longer works
- I have downloaded data archives for all of my accounts, except ~@palevell~, since it remains suspended
- Unless something at Twitter changes, I am unable to continue with this project
** October 11, 2023
- There is a package named, ~twscrape~ that is based on ~snscrape~, which seems to satisfy my requirements for obtaining data for account maintenance
** October 18, 2023
- First batch of Twitter data fetched by ~twscrape~ appears to be complete
- This has been a project external to this one
- In its last iteration, ~acct_maint.py~ relied on the Twitter data dump to determine which users to process
- I will try to adapt ~acct_maint.py~ to process the offline Twitter data, especially since I haven't explored how to use ~twscrape~ in Python.
