* Description
- This started as a way to adapt my earlier account maintenance programs to use ~snscrape~, since the free version of Twitter's API is inadequate for my purposes
** July 7, 2023
- Then, Twitter made their site unavailable to the public, and ~snscrape~ no longer works
- I have downloaded data archives for all of my accounts, except ~@palevell~, since it remains suspended
- Unless something at Twitter changes, I am unable to continue with this project
** October 11, 2023
- There is a package named, ~twscrape~ that is based on ~snscrape~, which seems to satisfy my requirements for obtaining data for account maintenance
